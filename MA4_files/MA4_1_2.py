"""
1. List comprehension: returns a list of coordinates; points = [[r.uniform(-1,1) for _ in range(d)] for _ in range(n)] 
2. lamda function: simple functions, also called anonymous functions
3. reduce(): Purpose of reduce is to reducean iterable (list, tuple, etc) down to a value
    (lambda acc, x: acc + x**2, point, 0) takes the list, point, and for each coord x squares it to the sum acc, acc starts at 0
    reduce() to reduce to a value, returns a a sum of squares
    take sqrt for the Euclidean distance
4. map() applies distance() to each point, transforming the list of points into a list of distances.
5.filter(): Takes 2 arg: 
    1) A function that returns True or False for each element.
    2) An iterable (in this case, points, which is a list of random points).
    (lambda p: p <= 1, distances): It filters the distances list to keep only those distances that are less than or equal to 1
    The filter() function only returns thoose points where lamda is True
    Lastly, needs to be converted to a list to take the lenght
